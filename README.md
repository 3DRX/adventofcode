In year 2022, I decided to make videos of me solving AoC problems in C++.
The style of which is going to be calm and mild, there will be no speaking, just me coding.
It's going to be more of a "study with me" kind of videos.

I hope you enjoy the videos, your like and subscribe will be highly appreciated.
